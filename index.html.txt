    <h1>I'm Sorry Gloria 💔</h1>
    <p>
      My dearest Gloria,<br><br>
      I know I’ve hurt you with my words or actions, and I can never express how deeply sorry I am. I hate that I made you feel upset, even for a moment. <br><br>
      You are the most precious part of my life, and I never want to see you sad — especially not because of me. I miss your smile, your voice, and the way you say my name. <br><br>
      Please forgive me, papaaaaa. I promise to be better, love you harder, and never take you for granted again.<br><br>
      I love you more than words could ever describe. Always yours, no matter what. ❤️<br><br>
      – Your Avinash
